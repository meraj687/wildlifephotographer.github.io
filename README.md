The problem statement have been created with the help of php and phpmyadmin. And the information input from the webpage moves to the database of php i.e phpmyadmin but for getting visible all the information move to the database first of all you need to install the xampp software and start the apache and sql port then only you will be able to see the web page created with the help of php.The php contain add,update and delete but for that you need to create the server and you need to write the little bit code for ajex to make it run.And most important you need to save the folder in the xampp folder then only the localhost for the webpage you have created will run otherwise the webpage wont work.You have to input the cdn from bootstraps and also from the ajax jquery inside the head in index.php. All the html and to make page attractive and beautiful i.e css code all are done inside the index.php and link action.php with the index.php.And in action.php for the images the image it should be in compress form by adjusting the height and width.Under phpmyadmin you need to give id as a primary key so that when you are adding the images it will auto incremented you dont need to write everytime the id number it will incremented automatically.If you will not give auto incrementation then you get only one images and if you want to add another image then you have to delete previous image then only i will work.Everytime you need to delete the previous images.I used change and remove instead of update and delete.
